# Streamlined Instructor Scheduling Workflow - COMPREHENSIVE PLAN

## Problem Statement

Current scheduling requires 8-10 clicks through 4 steps, asks for redundant information, lacks mission time block displays, has critical bugs preventing mission creation, and has no automated notification system for students or instructors.

## Vision

Create a hyper-intuitive, anticipatory scheduling system that:
- Knows before asking (context-aware)
- Communicates proactively (automatic notifications)
- Handles edge cases gracefully (weather, conflicts, cancellations)
- Feels natural and effortless (2-4 clicks to schedule)
- Uses voice + AI for POA creation (async processing)
