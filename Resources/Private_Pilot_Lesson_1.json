  "performance_standards": "We\u2019re not expecting perfection this early \u2014 the goal is to understand the relationship between slow flight and the landing phase. If by the end of the flight you can safely fly slow flight in both configurations, recognize stalls, and start to correlate those skills with real-world landings, we\u2019re in great shape.",

  "final_thoughts": "This lesson is a major building block for everything that follows in your training. Takeoffs and landings are where everything comes together, and slow flight is the foundation. If we have time after the flight, we\u2019ll kick off our deeper dive into aeronautical decision-making by starting the PAVE checklist, focusing on \u201cP \u2013 Pilot\u201d (which includes the IMSAFE checklist)."
