Sporty’s   Complete   Flight Training Course  Training Course Outline   Page i  Course Introduction  TRAINING COURSE OUTLINE  PRIVATE PILOT - AIRPLANE  COURSE INTRODUCTION  The Private Pilot Training Course Outline is the syllabus portion of the Sporty’s Academy 14  CFR part 141* Approved Private Pilot Certification Course. This outline provides a logical,  structured sequence that maximizes learning and meets 14 CFR part 141 training time  requirements. Training times must be increased slightly to meet 14 CFR part 61* requirements  for students training under those rules. This Training Course Outline also contains ground  lessons appropriate to the Private Pilot certificate and supplemental lessons for additional  training as necessary.  COURSE CONCEPT  The Private Pilot Training Course Outline utilizes the building-block theory of learning, which  rec ognizes that each item taught must be presented on the basis of previously learned  knowledge and skills.  For optimum effectiveness, the ground lessons and viewing of the associated videos should  be completed prior to the respective flight lessons. If a considerable length of time has elapsed  between the ground lesson and the associated flight, the instructor may wish to conduct a  short review of essential material.  INFORMATION FOR FLIGHT SCHOOLS AND FLIGHT INSTRUCTORS USING THIS  TRAINING COURSE OUTLINE (TCO)  Sporty’s Private Training Course Outline integrates content from Sporty’s online Learn to  Fly Course training content applicable to 14 CFR Part 141 Appendix B (3)(b) - Private Pilot  Certification Course, Aeronautical Knowledge Training.  The video-based lessons in Sporty’s Learn to Fly Course cover all of the aeronautical  knowledge areas in 14 CFR Part 141 Appendix B (3)(b) and can be used to satisfy up to 20  of the 35 required ground training hours. The applicable online training content is noted by  “ADDITIONAL STUDY” at the end of the ground lesson where appropriate.  Sporty’s Learn to Fly Course provides electronic tracking of the student’s time spent on each  topic which is viewable by the flight instructor. The additional ground training portion may be  presented to the student as a formal classroom program or individually by the instructor.  COURSE ELEMENTS  The course includes the latest FAA pilot certification requirements and a maximum of  student-oriented instruction. The syllabus and support materials not only provide necessary  information, but also guide the student through the course in a logical manner.  *14 CFR part 141 and 14 CFR part 61 refer to the appropriate parts of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Title 14 covers  aeronautics and space. The regulations in this title are often referred to as the Federal Aviation Regulations or FARs.

What You Should Know  Page ii   Private Pilot  Course Introduction  STUDENT VIDEO PREPARATION  The Sporty’s Private Pilot Training Course Outline is based on Sporty’s   Complete   Learn  To Fly Course, Private Pilot path, online and via apps (iOS, Apple TV, Android, Roku). It  is important that the student view all six volumes in the Private Pilot path. For each lesson,  there is additional study of specific video sections and this should be accomplished as part of  a self-study program. Additional topics may also be assigned by the instructor. To maximize  the learning benefit of the videos, the student should also review the additional study sections  after completion of the lesson. This is particularly true of any subject areas where the student  encountered difficulty.  PREFLIGHT ORIENTATION  Prior to each dual lesson, the instructor must provide the student with a thorough overview  of the subject matter to be covered during the lesson. The instructor should select a quiet,  private place to brief the student and explain the lesson material. It is important that the  instructor define unfamiliar terms and explain the maneuvers and objectives of each lesson.  AIRPLANE PRACTICE  Airplane practice must be conducted so that the student obtains the maximum benefit from  each flight. Each flight, where applicable, should begin with a review of previously practiced  maneuvers, as deemed necessary by the instructor, before any new maneuvers are  introduced.  POSTFLIGHT EVALUATION  The postflight evaluation is equally as important as the preflight orientation. During each  postflight session, the student must be thoroughly debriefed. Noticeable advancement should  be apparent and recommendations should be made for improvement, where appropriate.  This action is a valuable instructional technique because it increases retention. The instructor  must also discuss the elements of the next lesson. This prepares the student for the video  assignment and will enhance the student’s understanding.  LESSON TIMES  Lesson times are specified as a guide to meeting the 14 CFR part 141 training requirements  for the Private Pilot. Under the building block concept, however, the student must achieve  a specific level of proficiency before starting the next lesson. Lessons may be combined or  repeated as needed based on the progress made by the student. It is imperative that the  instructor and student periodically review the student’s overall progress and determine that  the training requirements are consistently being met.  STUDENT STAGE CHECKS AND END-OF-COURSE TESTS  Stage checks measure the student’s accomplishments during each stage of training. This  procedure provides close supervision of training and another opinion on the student’s  progress. An examination of the building-block theory of learning will show that it is extremely  important for progress and proficiency to be satisfactory before the student enters a new

Sporty’s   Complete   Flight Training Course  Training Course Outline   Page iii  Course Introduction  stage of training. Therefore, the next stage should not begin until the student successfully  completes the current stage. Failure to follow this progression may defeat the purpose of the  stage check and lead to overall course breakdown.  GRADING INSTRUCTIONAL LESSONS  Evaluation is an essential part of the teaching process. The student must be apprised of  his or her progress. All instructional flights must be graded in accordance with the following  criteria.  Each pilot operation or task will be evaluated at the completion of each instructional lesson.  1 = EXCELLENT   The   student   demonstrates   knowledge   or   skills   with   no  procedural or mechanical errors and the flight instructor does  not provide any assistance  2 = ABOVE  AVERAGE  The student demonstrates knowledge or skills that exceed  standards. Occasional procedural or mechanical errors are  quickly recognized and corrected.  3 = AVERAGE   The student consistently demonstrates knowledge and skills  that meet standards with timely recognition of procedural or  mechanical errors.  4 = BELOW  AVERAGE  The student demonstrates knowledge and skills with difficulty,  is slow in recognizing and correcting procedural or mechanical  errors.  5 = BELOW  ACCEPTABLE  STANDARDS  The   student   does   not   demonstrate   adequate   knowledge  or skills, is unable to recognize and correct procedural or  mechanical errors.  I = INCOMPLETE   The student has not completed the pilot operation listed.  Each instructional lesson will be assigned an overall grade based on the following criteria.  S = SATIS-  FACTORY  The content of the lesson has been completed to the  standards outlined in the individual lesson Completion  Standards.  U = UNSATIS-  FACTORY  Indicates that all or part of the lesson content was not  completed to the standards outlined in the individual lesson  Completion Standards. One or more pilot operations graded  as a “5” will require an overall grade of unsatisfactory.  I = INCOMPLETE   Indicates the content of the lesson was not completed,  but the pilot operations covered were satisfactory. Pilot  operations not completed must be indicated with an “I”.

What You Should Know  Page iv   Private Pilot  Course Introduction  RECORDING SOLO LESSONS  The student will indicate each pilot operation performed on the solo lesson sheet with a check mark. Any pilot operation performed that is not listed must be noted in the remarks section. Cross-country routes shall also be recorded in the remarks section. The overall solo lesson will be assigned a “grade” based on the following criteria. SP = STUDENT PRACTICE All completed solo lessons should be graded as Student Practice. I = INCOMPLETE   The student did not complete all the pilot operations listed on the lesson sheet.  GRADING NOTES  1.   When an instructional lesson is graded unsatisfactory, only those pilot operations graded as “5” must be repeated to standards during the next lesson. 2.   When any lesson is graded incomplete, the pilot operations not performed must be completed prior to attempting the pilot operations for the next lesson. 3.   Use the “TOTAL IN COURSE: (D/S/G)” lines within the grading box to total the student’s dual, solo, and ground instruction times in the course after each lesson.  TSA FLIGHT TRAINING SECURITY PROGRAM RECORDS  The TSA mandated Flight Training Security Program (FTSP) has a number of compliance and record keeping requirements. Refer to the TSA website for details. The inside front cover of this book has a place to record that you have completed the requirements. That line is there to serve as a reminder to complete the TSA mandates but does not meet the documentation requirements. Per the TSA, an instructor may elect to use an endorsement in the Student’s   and   the Instructor’s logbooks to document confirmation of a Student’s U.S. Citizenship (not allowed for a non-U.S. citizen). The Instructor’s copy of the record must be kept for at least 5 years after expiration or discontinuance of use. The recommended text of the endorsement is as follows: “I certify that [insert student’s name] has presented me a [insert type of document presented, such as a U.S. birth certificate or U.S. passport, and the relevant control or sequential number on the document, if any] establishing that [the student] is a U.S. citizen or U.S. national in accordance with 49 CFR 1552.7(a). [Insert date and instructor’s signature and CFI number.]” For details or clarification, refer to the TSA’s website.
