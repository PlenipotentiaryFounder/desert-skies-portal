6. TRAINING DELIVERY
6.1. Lesson Completion & Stage Checks
Every dual flight, simulator lesson, Stage or End Of Course Check will be given an overall grade by the
authorized Flight Instructor or Check Instructor. Satisfactory completion of each flight lesson will be based
on the Completion Standard of that lesson and successful completion of the tasks assigned. The following
Overall Grading Standards will be used for each dual lesson and Stage Check of the Flight Training Course.
• S = Satisfactory : Student performance meets the Completion Standard(s) of the lesson or the
level of competency and/or proficiency specified in each task.
• U = Unsatisfactory: Student performance failed to meet the Completion Standard(s) or the level
of mandatory competency or proficiency for that lesson in one or more tasks. In case a lesson is
graded unsatisfactory, that lesson will have to be repeated until a satisfactory lesson outcome is
graded before continuing further in the course.
• I = Incomplete: If any of the INTRODUCE/DEMONSTRATE line items and a maximum of 3 REVIEW
items are not able to be attempted due to illness, maintenance, weather or any operational
restrictions outside of the crew(s) control, then an incomplete grade on the lesson may be
assigned and carried over to the subsequent lesson with a satisfactory grade.
If the student performance fails to meet the required minimum standard(s) and cannot be improved
during the lesson, an Unsatisfactory grade will be given.
6.2. Flight Training Syllabus Stages
The Flight Training Syllabus consists of the following stages:
Stage 1: Training up to initial solo.
Stage 2: Training up to the initial solo cross-country flight.
Stage 3: Preparation for FAA Private Pilot Airplane Single-engine land practical test.
Stages must be flown in the sequence prescribed, but individual lessons inside a given stage may be flown
out of sequence when necessary to accommodate the individual Student’s progress or any operational
efficiencies.
Anytime a lesson is flown out of order, prior approval from the Chief Instructor or Assistant Chief
Instructor must be obtained and the appropriate reason must be documented in activity completion
comments section by the assigned instructor.
6.3. Pre-Solo Written Examination
Prior to taking the Pre-solo Stage Check, the student must have completed a pre-solo written examination
with a minimum first-time score of 70% and corrected to 100% by the authorized instructor.
FAA 141 PPC – TCO & SYLLABUS 13
6.4. Grading Standards
Each required task or element specified in the Lesson Plan for each flight lesson or Stage Check will be
given a Task Grade by the authorized Flight Instructor, Check Instructor, or Chief Instructor. Satisfactory
completion of each task will be based on the Completion Standard of that lesson, successful completion of
the tasks assigned, and the performance level specified for that task. Where a lesson plan specifies a task
be performed to Private Pilot Airman Certification Standards or other specified level, the student must
demonstrate performance of the task to the appropriately specified level to receive a Satisfactory grade in
that task. The following Grading Practices will be used for each task/element in each dual lesson or Stage
Check of the Flight Training Course:
• Incomplete (I) – Line item not attempted.
• One (1) – Unsatisfactory, insufficient progress in acquiring the knowledge and skills to
achieve proficiency.
• Two (2) – Progressing, increasing progress towards proficiency in meeting ACS standards.
• Three (3) – ACS Standard, the exercise has been understood and performance is consistently
repeatable within the ACS Standards.
• Four (4) – Exemplary, Performance including the level of knowledge, skills and attitude
demonstrated exceeds expectations.
6.5. Training Records
TALON ETA: ETA is a data collection, scheduling and training records tool which is used to manage the
curriculum.
In addition to normal comments, reason codes are encouraged when assigning a grade of unsatisfactory
on a line item that is not associated with normal progression.
The information maintained in ETA shall be in accordance with 14 CFR 141.101 and must be made
available upon request of the student.
TALON ETA Reason Codes:
APK – Application of Procedures – Incorrect accomplishment of a known procedure.
PSD – Problem Solving & Decision Making - No decision or a flawed decision-making process
(inquiry, advocacy, conflict resolution, critique).
FPM – Flight Path Management – Manual flying skills:
a. TS (Airspeed) – Deviations exceeding prescribed ATO limits for the phase of flight or an inability
to maintain a stabilized airspeed.
b. TC (Aircraft Control) – Inability to maintain positive aircraft control and/or attitude excursions
beyond prescribed limits.
c. TV (Altitude Control) – Deviations exceeding prescribed ATO limits for the phase of flight.
d. TL (Heading Control) – Deviations exceeding prescribed ATO limits for the phase of flight.
e. TA (Automation Management) – Inability to properly use automation Systems or a lack of
recognition of automation anomalies.
FPA – Flight Path Automation – Use of automation/FCP & autopilot – inappropriate or no
understanding of selected modes potentially causing a loss of situational awareness or aircraft
control.
COM - Communication – Deficient intra-cockpit communication, incorrect phraseology,
readback/hear back shortfalls, or deficient ATC communications.
FAA 141 PPC – TCO & SYLLABUS 14
SAW - Situational Awareness – Failure to assess and anticipate future conditions; a lack of
orientation to the terrain, weather, or flight path; improper interpretation of flight displays; or a
failure to maintain crew awareness.
LTW – Leadership & Teamwork – Failed teamwork, deficient followership, lack of professionalism in
the execution of SOPs, or a failure to sustain a positive crew climate.
WLM - Workload Management – Deficient prioritization and sequencing of tasks; inadequate
planning; deficient departure/approach briefings; or the failure to anticipate high workload.
6.6. FACILITATED DEBRIEFINGS
A facilitated debriefing in its simplest terms is a guided discussion where the instructor creates an
environment that enables self-critique and self-reflection.
Properly executed, facilitated debriefings can have a powerful impact on learning as personal lessons
learned are retained and often do result in changing an individual’s behavior and methods.
Several factors can inhibit or limit the effectiveness of facilitated debriefings—culture, personal attitudes,
and the knowledge level of the individual are three examples. Nevertheless, the potential benefits
associated with facilitated debriefings are significant.
Facilitated debriefings are most appropriately implemented once the concept of self-critique is introduced
and foundation aviation skills have been established.
FAA 141 PPC – TCO & SYLLABUS 15
7. Stage One Objective – Initial competency and proficiency.........................................................................
Pilots will be introduced to and develop competency and proficiency in the aviation environment (first airborne
experience), including basic VFR Airmanship skills, stall and spin awareness and avoidance, normal and emergency
procedures, normal patterns, takeoffs and landings, ATC communications, and operations in the National Airspace
System.
Stage One Completion Standard
At the end of this stage the student will be able to:
• Perform preflight preparation procedures and checks.
• Perform normal takeoffs and landings.
• Perform normal traffic patterns.
• Perform normal procedures.
• Understand and comply with ATC communications for local flights.
• Achieve adequate competency and proficiency with certain failures, such as engine failure while in
the pattern, radio communication failure and complete electrical failure.
