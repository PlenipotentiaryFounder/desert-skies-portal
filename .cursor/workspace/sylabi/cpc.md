FAA 141 CPC D
Training Course outline and Syllabus
2.4.1 COURSE OBJECTIVE
The Pilot will obtain the knowledge, skill and aeronautical experience necessary to
meet the requirements for a Commercial Pilot Certificate with Airplane Multi-Engine
Land and Instrument Airplane Rating. This course will be conducted parallel to the
14 CFR Part 141, FAA 141 CPC AKT course or the 14 CFR Part 141, 141 CPC AKT
course, as approved for CAE Aviation Academy Phoenix, LLC. Once a student is
enrolled in the FAA 141 CPC AKT or 141 CPC AKT they must finish that course and
cannot be transferred to the other.
2.5 COMPLETION STANDARDS
The Pilot must demonstrate through written tests, practical tests, and through
appropriate oral quizzing that he/she meets the knowledge, skill and experience
requirements necessary to obtain a Commercial Pilot Certificate. To graduate from
this course, Pilots must successfully complete all flight training stages, meet
Commercial Pilot ACS standards and pass the end of course check. This course
may be conducted concurrently with the FAA 141 IRA course. Prior to starting
stage three, pilots must have an instrument rating. The Pilot must have graduated
from the FAA 141 CPC AKT course or the 141 CPC AKT course, prior to performing
the End of Course check in this course.
2.6 UNSATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE
If the Pilot fails to meet a given lesson’s completion standards, the flight must be graded as
“unsatisfactory” and repeated until they are met. If a stage check or end of course check
completion standards are not met, it must be graded as “unsatisfactory” and the lesson
prior to the relevant check must be repeated while focusing on the unsatisfactory
subject areas. Once the Pilot has satisfactory knowledge and skills of the
appropriate subject areas and line items, they may reattempt the check.

6 TRAINING DELIVERY
6.1 LESSON COMPLETION and STAGE CHECKS
Every dual flight, simulator lesson, Stage or End Of Course Check will be given an
overall grade by the authorized Flight Instructor or Check Instructor. Satisfactory
completion of each flight lesson will be based on the Completion Standard of that
lesson and successful completion of the tasks assigned. The following Overall
Grading Standards will be used for each dual lesson and Stage Check of the Flight
Training Course.
• S = Satisfactory: Pilot performance meets the Completion Standard(s) of the
lesson or the standards of competency and/or proficiency specified in each task.
• U = Unsatisfactory : Pilot performance failed to meet the Completion
Standard(s) or the standards of mandatory competency or proficiency for that
lesson in one or more tasks. In case a lesson is graded unsatisfactory, that
lesson will have to be repeated until a satisfactory lesson outcome is graded
before continuing further in the course.
• I = Incomplete : If any of the INTRODUCE/DEMONSTRATE line items and a
maximum of 3 REVIEW items are not able to be attempted due to illness,
maintenance, weather or any operational restrictions outside of the crew(s)
control, then an incomplete grade on the lesson may be assigned and carried
over to the subsequent lesson with a satisfactory grade.
If the Pilot performance fails to meet the required minimum standard(s) and cannot
be improved during the lesson, an Unsatisfactory grade will be given.
FAA 141 CPC D
Training Course outline and Syllabus
FAA 141 CPC D
6.2 FLIGHT TRAINING SYLLABUS STAGES
The Flight Training Syllabus consists of the following stages:
Stage 1: Training up to Commercial Pilot Airplane Single Engine Land VFR
Navigation and maneuvers
Stage 2: Training with instrument flight procedures
Stage 3 : Training up to VFR Navigation in a Multi-engine including maneuvers
and simulated emergencies
Stage 4: Training up to Multi-engine IFR procedures including simulated
emergencies in simulated IMC
Stage 5 : Preparation for FAA Commercial Pilot Airplane Multi Engine Land
practical test
Stages must be flown in the sequence prescribed, but individual lessons inside a
given stage may be flown out of sequence when necessary to accommodate the
individual Pilot ’s progress or any operational efficiencies. Anytime a lesson is flown
out of order, prior approval from the Chief Instructor or Assistant Chief Instructor
must be obtained and the appropriate reason must be documented in activity
completion comments section by the assigned instructor.
6.3 GRADING STANDARDS
Each required task or element specified in the Lesson Plan for each flight lesson or
Stage Check will be given a Task Grade by the authorized Flight Instructor, Check
Instructor, or Chief Instructor. Satisfactory completion of each task will be based on
the Completion Standard of that lesson, successful completion of the tasks assigned,
and the performance standards specified for that task. Where a lesson plan specifies
a task be performed to Commercial Pilot Airman Certification Standards or other
specified standards, the Pilot must demonstrate performance of the task to the
appropriately specified standards to receive a Satisfactory grade in that task. The
following Grading Practices will be used for each task/element in each dual lesson or
Stage Check of the Flight Training Course:
• Incomplete (I) – Line item not attempted.
• One (1) – Unsatisfactory, insufficient progress in acquiring the knowledge and
skills to achieve proficiency.
• Two (2) – Progressing, increasing progress towards proficiency in meeting
Commercial Pilot ACS standards.
• Three (3) – Commercial Pilot ACS standards, the exercise has been understood
and performance is consistently repeatable within the Commercial Pilot ACS
standards.
•^ Four (4) –^ Exemplary, Performance including the standards of knowledge,^ skills^
and attitude demonstrated exceeds expectations.

6.4 TRAINING RECORDS
TALON ETA: ETA is a data collection, scheduling and training records tool
which is used to manage the curriculum.
In addition to normal comments, reason codes are encouraged when assigning a
grade of unsatisfactory on a line item that is not associated with normal
progression.
The information maintained in ETA shall be in accordance with 14 CFR 141.101
and must be made available upon request of the Pilot.
TALON ETA Reason Codes:
1. APK – Application of Procedures – Incorrect accomplishment of a known
procedure.
2. PSD – Problem Solving & Decision Making - No decision or a flawed decision-
making process (inquiry, advocacy, conflict resolution, critique).
3. FPM – Flight Path Management – Manual flying skills
a. TS (Airspeed) – Deviations exceeding prescribed ATO limits for the
