6. TRAINING DELIVERY
6.1. LESSON COMPLETION & STAGE CHECKS
Every dual flight, simulator lesson, Stage or End Of Course Check will be given an overall grade by the authorized

Flight Instructor or Check Instructor. Satisfactory completion of each flight lesson will be based on the Completion

Standard of that lesson and successful completion of the tasks assigned. The following Overall Grading Standards

will be used for each dual lesson and Stage Check of the Flight Training Course.

• S = Satisfactory : Student performance meets the Completion Standard(s) of the lesson or the level of competency
and/or proficiency specified in each task.
• U = Unsatisfactory: Student performance failed to meet the Completion Standard(s) or the level of mandatory
competency or proficiency for that lesson in one or more tasks. In case a lesson is graded unsatisfactory, that
lesson will have to be repeated until a satisfactory lesson outcome is graded before continuing further in the
course.
• I = Incomplete: If any of the INTRODUCE/DEMONSTRATE line items and a maximum of 3 REVIEW items are not able
to be attempted due to illness, maintenance, weather or any operational restrictions outside of the crew(s)
control, then an incomplete grade on the lesson may be assigned and carried over to the subsequent lesson with a
satisfactory grade.
If the student performance fails to meet the required minimum standard(s) and cannot be improved during

the lesson, an Unsatisfactory grade will be given.

6.2. FLIGHT TRAINING SYLLABUS STAGES
The Flight Training Syllabus consists of the following stages:

Stage 1: Basic Instrument Flying, Radio Navigation, and Holding Pattern Training

Stage 2: Instrument Approach and IFR Navigation Training
Stages must be flown in the sequence prescribed, but individual lessons inside a given stage may be flown out of

sequence when necessary to accommodate the individual Student’s progress or any operational efficiencies. Anytime a

lesson is flown out of order, prior approval from the Chief Instructor or Assistant Chief Instructor must be obtained and

the appropriate reason must be documented in activity completion comments section by the assigned instructor.

6.3. GRADING STANDARDS
Each required task or element specified in the Lesson Plan for each flight lesson or Stage Check will be given a Task

Grade by the authorized Flight Instructor, Check Instructor, or Chief Instructor. Satisfactory completion of each

task will be based on the Completion Standard of that lesson, successful completion of the tasks assigned, and the

performance level specified for that task. Where a lesson plan specifies a task be performed to Instrument Rating

Airplane Airman Certification Standards or other specified level, the student must demonstrate performance of

the task to the appropriately specified level to receive a Satisfactory grade in that task. The following Grading

Practices will be used for each task/element in each dual lesson or Stage Check of the Flight Training Course:

FAA 141 IRA- TCO & Syllabus
Incomplete (I) – Line item not attempted.
One (1) – Unsatisfactory, insufficient progress in acquiring the knowledge and skills to achieve proficiency.
Two (2) – Progressing, increasing progress towards proficiency in meeting ACS standards.
Three (3) – ACS Standard, the exercise has been understood and performance is consistently repeatable
within the ACS Standards.
Four (4) – Exemplary, Performance including the level of knowledge, skills and attitude demonstrated
exceeds expectations.
6.4 TRAINING RECORDS
TALON ETA: ETA is a data collection, scheduling and training records tool which is used to manage the curriculum.

In addition to normal comments, reason codes are encouraged when assigning a grade of unsatisfactory on a line item

that is not associated with normal progression.

beyond prescribed limits.
c. TV (Altitude Control) – Deviations exceeding prescribed ATO limits for the phase of flight.
d. TL (Heading Control) – Deviations exceeding prescribed ATO limits for the phase of flight.
e. TA (Automation Management) – Inability to properly use automation Systems or a lack of
recognition of automation anomalies.
FPA – Flight Path Automation – Use of automation/FCP & autopilot – inappropriate or no understanding of
selected modes potentially causing a loss of situational awareness or aircraft control.
COM - Communication – Deficient intra-cockpit communication, incorrect phraseology, readback/hear back
shortfalls, or deficient ATC communications.
SAW - Situational Awareness – Failure to assess and anticipate future conditions; a lack of orientation to the
FAA 141 IRA- TCO & Syllabus
terrain, weather, or flight path; improper interpretation of flight displays; or a failure to maintain crew
awareness.
LTW – Leadership & Teamwork – Failed teamwork, deficient followership, lack of professionalism in the execution of
SOPs, or a failure to sustain a positive crew climate.
WLM - Workload Management – Deficient prioritization and sequencing of tasks; inadequate
planning; deficient departure/approach briefings; or the failure to anticipate high workload
FAA 141 IRA- TCO & Syllabus
7. STAGE ONE OBJECTIVE – Initial competency and proficiency
Pilots will be introduced to and develop competency and proficiency in the instrument aviation environment, including

basic Instrument Airmanship skills, basic attitude instrument flying, recovery from unusual attitudes in a simulated IMC

environment, flight by reference to standby instruments, radio navigation orientation, course intercepting and tracking
