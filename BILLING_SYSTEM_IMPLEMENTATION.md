## 🚧 Phase 6: Aircraft Billing (PENDING)

**Status**: Schemas created, awaiting `aircraft` table creation

### Ready to Implement
Once the `aircraft` table exists, the system supports:
- DSA-owned aircraft (standard rental rates)
- DSA-leased aircraft (passthrough costs + margin)
- Third-party aircraft (full passthrough + convenience fee)
- Bundled pricing (aircraft + instruction + fuel)
- Multi-party ledger splits (student → platform → aircraft owner)

**Action Required**: Create `aircraft` table, then apply `aircraft-billing-schema.sql`

---

## 📊 Phase 7: Testing & Validation (NEXT STEPS)

### Recommended Testing Workflow

#### 1. Shadow Mode Testing
Run the new billing system in parallel with existing system:
```typescript
// Call new billing after existing billing
await processFlightCompletionBilling({...})
// Compare results, don't rely on new system yet
```

#### 2. Reconciliation Validation
- Run daily reconciliation: `performDailyReconciliation()`
- Check for drift: Should be < $10
- Verify ledger balance: Sum of all wallets must equal 0

#### 3. Margin Verification
- Compare platform wallet growth to actual margins
- Verify: `student_charge - instructor_payout = platform_margin`
- Check: Platform wallet matches Stripe available balance

#### 4. Credit Limit Testing
- Test credit limit enforcement before flight booking
- Verify auto-charge triggers work
- Test limit escalation logic

#### 5. Transfer Testing
- Create test instructor Connect account
- Process test flight with small amount
- Verify transfer appears in `instructor_transfers`
- Check webhook updates transfer status to `paid`

#### 6. Adjustment Testing
- Adjust test flight hours
- Verify adjustment created correctly
- Test approval workflow
- Verify settlement posts to ledger

## 🎯 How to Use the System

### For Flight Completion

```typescript
import { processFlightCompletionBilling } from '@/lib/instructor-billing-service'

// After flight is completed
const result = await processFlightCompletionBilling({
  flightSessionId: session.id,
  studentId: session.student_id,
  instructorId: session.instructor_id,
  flightHours: 1.5,
  groundHours: 0.5,
  isInstantPayout: false // or true for instant
})

if (result.success) {
  console.log('Margin:', result.margin_cents / 100)
  console.log('Journal:', result.journal_id)
}
```

### For Credit Checks

```typescript
import { checkCreditLimit } from '@/lib/credit-limit-service'

// Before allowing flight booking
const check = await checkCreditLimit(studentId, proposedChargeCents)

if (!check.allowed) {
  return { error: check.blocked_reason }
}

if (check.warning) {
  // Show warning to student
}
```

### For Reserve Monitoring

```typescript
import { checkPlatformReserve } from '@/lib/reserve-monitoring-service'

// Run periodically (or before large payouts)
const reserve = await checkPlatformReserve()

if (reserve.should_block_transfers) {
  // Alert admin, block instructor payouts
}
```

### For Flight Adjustments

```typescript
import { adjustFlightSession } from '@/lib/flight-adjustment-service'

// If flight hours need correction
const adjustment = await adjustFlightSession({
  flightSessionId: sessionId,
  newFlightHours: 1.8, // was 1.5
  adjustmentReason: 'Hobbs meter correction',
  adjustedBy: userId
})
```

## 📋 Database Functions Reference

### Ledger Functions
- `post_journal_with_locks(p_journal_id, p_event_type, p_event_id, p_currency, p_entries)`
- `get_total_student_balances()` → INTEGER (cents)
- `get_total_instructor_balances()` → INTEGER (cents)
- `get_total_liability_balances()` → INTEGER (cents)

### Helper Functions
- `acquire_wallet_lock(p_wallet_id)` → BOOLEAN
- `check_journal_balance()` → TRIGGER

---

## 🔒 Security & Compliance

### Row Level Security (RLS)
All tables have RLS enabled with appropriate policies:
- Students see their own wallets and transactions
- Instructors see their own payouts and adjustments
- Admins see everything
- Service role bypasses RLS for system operations

### Audit Trail
Complete audit trail for:
- Rate changes (who, when, why, old/new values)
- Adjustments (reason, approval, settlement)
- Transfers (status changes, clawbacks)
- Reconciliations (daily logs with drift detection)

### Concurrency Control
- Advisory locks on wallet operations
- Transaction-level balance enforcement
- Idempotency keys for transfers (outbox pattern)
- Deferrable constraint triggers

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Drift Detected
**Cause**: Ledger doesn't match Stripe balance
**Solution**: Check for missing webhooks, run reconciliation, verify all transfers posted

#### Transfer Stuck in Pending
**Cause**: Webhook not received or outbox processing failed
**Solution**: Check Stripe dashboard, manually process outbox entry, verify webhook endpoint

#### Credit Limit Blocking Flight
**Cause**: Student exceeded limit
**Solution**: Request payment or increase credit limit in admin dashboard

#### Adjustment Not Settling
**Cause**: Missing approval or settlement method not specified
**Solution**: Approve in adjustments dashboard, specify settlement method

## 📈 Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented
- Materialized wallet balances (no need to sum ledger entries)
- Indexed foreign keys for fast joins
- Partial indexes for common queries (status filters)
- Deferred constraint checking for batch operations

### Monitoring Recommendations
- Track `post_journal_with_locks` execution time
- Monitor webhook processing latency
- Alert on reconciliation drift > $10
- Track outbox processing delays

## 🎓 Key Concepts

### Double-Entry Ledger
Every transaction has equal and opposite entries. For flights:
```
Student wallet:    -$100  (debit)
Instructor wallet: +$60   (credit)
Platform wallet:   +$40   (credit)
                   ----
Sum:                $0    (balanced)
```

### Reconciliation vs. Summation
**Wrong**: `platform_balance = stripe_balance + student_balances`
**Right**: `platform_balance ≈ stripe_balance` (with drift tolerance)

The ledger is internally consistent (double-entry). External cash (Stripe) should approximately match platform wallet after accounting for pending transactions.

### Clawback Window
Stripe Connect allows reversing transfers within a short window (typically T+72h). This system tracks clawback eligibility and automates the process for billing corrections.
